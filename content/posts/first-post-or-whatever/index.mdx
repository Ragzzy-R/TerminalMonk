###### The Beginning
I've been trying to get into this blogging thing for almost a decade. Started when I was in undergrad with Blogger,
then a bit of wordpress and failing miserably on writing one with HTML/CSS/JS. So this gig has been going on and off for
a while. I usually start off well and then get bored of writing things or run out of things to write or just go 'meh'
because no one reads its anyways.

###### TamilKanini
There was a brief period where one of my blog got fairly famous among a few friends of friends.
It was called *tamilkanini*. It was a tech blog written in tamil(my native language) which explains some
basic computer science concepts in tamil. Eventually, I was so noob back then(noober than the noob I am now).
So I wrote every single thing I know about computer science back then and ran out of content. People were asking for
more and I had none. So I had to fake my death and escape to Russia for a couple years.

###### The Youtube Era
Then came the whole youtube era where writing blogs was old school and everyone wants to jump on the new cool
youtube train. So I started with making small videos like **How to boot your ubuntu from USB** and some demo videos of
games I used to make back then. Making quality video was hard. Especially when you are recording on the cheapest mic
money can buy.

###### The Current Era
Fast forward a few years ( yeah I dont really remember the years), I just make funny(or I think) gaming videos of
me and my friends playing GTA5 or some random game and occasionally write something related to tech on Medium. Now
that we are living in the Coronaverse and that ** *everyone's gotta have a hobby* ** is the new rat race and more importantly,
I don't have any more new games to play, I'm gonna try and write some stupid shit like this and see how it goes. That's
pretty much it. Thank you for reading. Hopefully, next post is something useful to you than my very boring history.
Ragzzy out.
