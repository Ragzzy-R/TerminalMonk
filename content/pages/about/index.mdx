Hello! I'm Raghuram Iyer 'Ragzzy-R'. Front-End Developer by day, gamer at night and a proud geek at both times. This blog is just my place to put out my thoughts out loud. Some are related to gaming,
some are related to tech/coding and some are just random thoughts. hop on! grab a coffee! sit back and enjoy my nonsensical blabbering.
